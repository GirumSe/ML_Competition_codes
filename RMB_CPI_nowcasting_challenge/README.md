## this challenge  is to predict the Consumer Price Index (CPI) of south africa for a given month in the future using historical CPI data, air quality data from Sentinel-5P, as well as trade data from various sources.
## the competition spans for 8 months. the first 5 months were mini-challenges that gives time for the participants to finetune their models. the main challenge was to predict the last 3 months CPI but for that tweaking the models wasn't allowed. 
## their where 1209 participants enrolled to the competition but only 16 peoples finished it.
