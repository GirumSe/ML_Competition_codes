# QoS Prediction Challenge by ITU AI/ML in 5G Challenge
## The objective of this challenge is to leverage the Berlin V2X dataset to predict QoS for a wireless vehicle network. More specifically, several features from the primary and secondary cells of two commercial LTE mobile network operators in the metropolitan area of Berlin can be used alongside GPS and context information to predict the achieved throughput in the downlink.

 - ## my solution got 12th place(Gold medalist) on privet leaderboard.  
 ### my solution is based on lagging features and some statistical features engineered from the data given. i used a single catboost model for prediction that achieved 9604608.542 RMSE in evaluation.
